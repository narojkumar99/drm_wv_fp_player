An awesome  Flutter plugin for Playing Widevine and Fairplay(Incomplete still) DRM Contents For Android and IOS Phones

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter app for VOD based Apps
We have Integrated DRM for Flutter based VOD App
The development is Premature stage and I need volunteers to work on the IOS counter part
We used Android's [Exoplayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer),Framework to integrate in Native Android
And [video_player](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/video_player), in flutter
the following project is the combination of both Exoplayer and video_player (I don't have Mac-System to work on IOS part)
The project is still in beta stage. And I am trying to get all help i can get
I have completed 30% of the project.I will complete the remaining, once I get the time or resources

## Flutter Plugin
[plug-in package](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/),
a specialize package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.


For help getting started with Flutter, view Google's 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials,

## Installation

First, add `drm_wv_fp_player` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

### iOS

Warning: Still have to wait


### Android

Ensure the following permission is present in your Android Manifest file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

The Flutter project template adds it, so it may already be there.


### Supported Formats

- On Android, the backing player is [ExoPlayer](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/),
  please refer [here](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/supported-formats.html) for list of supported formats.
